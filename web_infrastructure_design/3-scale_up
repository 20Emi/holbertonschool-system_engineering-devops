Configuring a load balancer as a cluster involves distributing incoming traffic across multiple load balancer instances
for redundancy and failover.
Select a load balancer solution that supports clustering and failover, such as HAProxy,
Nginx, F5 BIG-IP or cloud provider load balancers such as AWS Elastic Load Balancer or Azure Load Balancer.
Provision multiple load balancer instances with identical configurations, including network settings,
listeners and backend server groups.
Configure health checks to monitor the availability and health of cluster instances. If an instance
fails the health check, it is considered unavailable.
Implement a failover mechanism that allows load balancer instances to detect and handle the failure
of other instances. This may involve updating DNS records or reassigning virtual IP addresses.
Establish monitoring and alerts to monitor cluster performance and availability, and manage
upgrades, patches and configuration changes in a consistent manner.
