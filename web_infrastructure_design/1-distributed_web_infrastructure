Active-Active Setup: In an active-active setup, all the load balancers in the
configuration actively distribute traffic and handle requests simultaneously.
This setup is often used to achieve higher performance and scalability.
Each load balancer shares the traffic load and works in parallel to distribute
requests across multiple servers or backend resources. If one load balancer fails,
the others continue to handle the traffic seamlessly. This configuration requires
careful load balancing algorithms and synchronization mechanisms to ensure
efficient distribution of requests.

Active-Passive Setup: In an active-passive setup, only one load balancer is
actively distributing traffic and handling requests at a given time, while the
others remain in a passive state, ready to take over in case of a failure. This
setup is commonly used for redundancy and failover purposes. The active load balancer
monitors the health of the passive load balancers and switches to a standby load
balancer if the active one becomes unavailable. This configuration typically requires
some form of synchronization or heartbeat mechanism to detect failures and trigger failover.
